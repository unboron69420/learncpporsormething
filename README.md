To whoever is reading this , 
I am going to learn as much as I can about c++ in 100 days, and hopefully become proficient/competent at the langugae.

One thing to know about me is that , I have not used my brain in any meaningful way in the last 7 years , because of which, I have lost all ability to solve porblems , learn even the basic sutff
of anything , two things which are incredibly important to learning c++ or any other languages for that matter. and I am 80% sure that i have Brainrot.

So this is going to be  a difficult task for me to achieve, but I am going to attempt it because , for all intents and pruposes , my life and my future ambitions depend on it , and I see no other way to a achieve complete my goals.
